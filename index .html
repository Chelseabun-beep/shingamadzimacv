    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Limitations:</strong> The reliance on geospatial data may not capture all local dynamics affecting HIV care, particularly in underserved communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-sectional Nature:</strong> The cross-sectional design limits the ability to establish causal relationships between sociodemographic factors and HIV care outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Generalizability:</strong> Findings may not be generalizable to populations outside of Zimbabwe or to different contexts within the country.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Research Gaps</h3>
    <p>The paper identifies several gaps that require further exploration:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Longitudinal Studies:</strong> Future research should include longitudinal studies to assess changes over time in HIV care outcomes and their determinants.</li>
        <li><strong>Qualitative Insights:</strong> Incorporating qualitative methods could provide deeper insights into the barriers faced by specific populations in accessing HIV care.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy Analysis:</strong> More research is needed on how national policies influence local implementation of HIV care programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Future Opportunities</h3>
    <p>The findings suggest several opportunities for improving HIV care in Zimbabwe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Targeted Interventions:</strong> Designing region-specific interventions based on identified clusters can help address unique challenges faced by different communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Enhancing community involvement in HIV care programs can improve awareness and uptake of services.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Optimizing resource allocation based on geospatial analyses can ensure that resources are directed where they are most needed.</li>

The fill is composed of micron-size crystals ‚Äúlaid‚Äù in the ‚Äúnest.‚Äù The size of the biomineral crystals outside the nest is larger, suggesting a different process or controls of formation. d. Differential dissolution induced by fungi along lines of substrate weakness. The cleavage planes on calcite crystals show straight and deep dissolution compared to the rest of the thin section. The pitting dissolution marks the entire thin section and produced columnar structures. It indicates removal of finer material. The fungal hyphae network crisscrossing the surface should be noticed. e. Differential dissolution induced by fungi along lines of substrate weakness and neoformation of biominerals which shows that the cleavage was filled with Ca-oxalates. f. Formation of alveolar-honeycomb structures by fungal interaction with dolomitic substrates. The chambers are deep and empty while the separating walls are topped by biominerals (white crystals). Here, the biomineral deposition on the grain boundaries is sharper and a clear layer of Ca-oxalate substrate has formed. The chambers form moldic porosity after the dissolved dolomite grains (Kolo and Claeys, 2005; Kolo et al., 2007).</em></figcaption>
