        <h3>BSc (Hons) Mining Engineering</h3>
        <h4>University of Zimbabwe</h4>
      <!-- About me content here -->
        
         <p>I am a dedicated mining engineer with a BSc (Hons) in Mining Engineering from the University of Zimbabwe, with experience in Geospatial Techniques and Advanced Machine Learning. I am excited about two main areas: first, examining how human activities impact microbial communities; second, integrating remote sensing with microbial data. Recent studies indicate a disconnect between the types of microbes present and their functional capabilities. Changes in environmental conditions can affect taxonomic diversity; however, functional redundancy often helps maintain ecosystem stability. This relationship is particularly relevant concerning per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), persistent environmental contaminants known to significantly alter microbial community structures and functions.</p>

        <p>I aim to explore advanced sequencing technologies that investigate microbial interactions and resilience mechanisms across diverse ecosystemsâ€”especially regarding PFAS exposure. Understanding how these pollutants impact microbial communities is crucial for developing strategies that mitigate their effects on ecosystem health. Furthermore, I plan to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to merge high-resolution remote sensing data with microbial metagenomic datasets. Current research emphasizes the need for improved methodologies when integrating complex omics data. By developing standardized workflows for omics data analysis and enhancing model interpretability, I hope to create robust predictive models for ecosystem health that can inform policy decisions and management strategies. Additionally, I'm interested in automating species detection in remote sensing imagery using deep learning algorithmsâ€”this could complement microbial evaluations by providing insights into diversity patterns across various environments.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Orbital Inclination in Remote Sensing Applications</h3>
    <p class="post-date">Posted on June 25, 2024</p>
    <!-- No image included -->
    <p>Orbital inclinationâ€”the angle between a satellite's orbital plane and Earth's equatorial planeâ€”is critical for how effectively remote sensing satellites collect data about our planet. Different inclinations offer unique advantages depending on specific observational goals; thus understanding their significance is essential for optimizing satellite missions.</p>

    <p>For instance, polar orbits (approximately 90 degrees inclination) allow satellites to pass over every part of Earth as it rotates beneath themâ€”enabling comprehensive global coverage ideal for applications like climate monitoring or land use mapping. This capability has made polar-orbiting satellites indispensable tools within programs such as NASA's Landsat series which provide continuous imagery spanning decades.</p>

    <p>Conversely, geostationary orbits (0 degrees inclination) keep satellites fixed above specific longitudes at an altitude where they match Earth's rotational speedâ€”ideal for continuous observation over particular regions like weather forecasting where real-time data collection is paramount.</p>

    <p>Inclination also affects revisit timesâ€”the frequency with which a satellite can observe any given location again after its initial passâ€”which plays an essential role when tracking dynamic phenomena such as natural disasters or agricultural changes throughout seasons.</p>

    <p>Selecting appropriate orbital inclinations based on mission objectives maximizes data collection efficiency while enhancing overall insights gained from remote sensing efforts across diverse fields including environmental science, agriculture, and urban planningâ€”all contributing toward informed decision-making processes aimed at safeguarding our planet's future sustainability goals effectively!</p>

           <h3>Challenges faced by local government in Tailings Management</h3>
           <p class="post-date">Posted on July 29, 2023</p>
           <p>Mining companies across Zimbabwe face increasing pressure from regulating authorities to find safer and more sustainable solutions for their tailings storage facilities. Due to the continuing risk of failure of tailings dams â€“ and the potential high environmental impact â€“ mining companies are compelled to take significant responsibility in finding safe rehabilitation solutions for their deposits.</p>

           <p>A multitude of solutions cost-effective tailings management and extensive knowledge on the efficient use of water put companies at the forefront of helping mines by offering re-handling and reprocessing solutions. The high economic potential for â€˜reminingâ€™ valuable minerals from legacy mining waste in tailings dams, a range of integrated solutions for tailings dewatering and mineral separation processing must be developed.</p>
         
         <p>Sustainable slurry transport is an effective and low-cost alternative to truck and shovel transport for the rehandling of stored mine tailings. This is especially the case where road transportation is not viable or large elevations in terrain have to be overcome. There is developed a semi-mobile tailings slurrification unit (TSU) for slurry generation and transport to a destination site. This is a sustainable alternative to conventional hauling equipment as it can be fed by an amphibious excavator and operate in areas with low bearing capacity (for example, due to high water content). Using a TSU significantly reduces the carbon footprint and personnel required in a tailings storage facility (TSF). In addition, it is a feasible and mobile alternative to diesel trucks in difficult-to-access and/or restricted areas.</p>

           <p>Effective water management is vital for sustainable mining operations, especially as many sites now face challenging limits on their freshwater intake, as well as discharge qualities. This is one of the key reasons why tailings thickeners are used: they settle out suspended solids and return the water back to the process plant to reduce the need for external fresh water. To enable the plant operator to continuously measure the rheology of the mine tailings an Autonomous Rheo Meter (ARM). The ARM measures rheology parameters of non-Newtonian slurries. As this process no longer needs to be done manually, this results in more improved measurement data, limited maintenance requirements and real-time data, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
         
         <p>As experts on slurry technology, our in-house innovations ensure optimal and safe water extraction and reuse in dewatering processes. Our extensive knowledge about soft sediments, slurry transport and rheology has allowed us to develop several unique technologies for water management and the beneficial reuse of tailings to create circular solutions.</p>

           <p>By combining all our different fields of expertise and having offices and representation in all major mining regions, we are able to offer a variety of bespoke tailings solutions.</p>

         <h3>Food Security Outlook June 2023 to January 2024</h3>
         <p class="post-date">Posted on June 21, 2023</p>
         <img src="FOOD.png" alt="Food Insecurity in Zimbabwe" class="responsive">
         <p>Access to water is declining across most typical semi-arid areas where rainfall has been well below average in November. In these areas, livestock and some people travel longer than normal distances to access water, reducing the time available for households to engage in other domestic and livelihood activities. Pasture conditions are also deteriorating in these areas, mainly negatively impacting cattle body conditions. A lack of access to clean water and good sanitation is also continuing to drive the national cholera outbreak, with more than 9,000 suspected cases and nearly 160 suspected cholera deaths recorded since February. Cases have been reported in 46 districts in all 10 provinces. In November, the government declared a state of emergency over Harare as cholera cases spiked and activated the Civil Protection Act. The government also set up Water Technical Committees in Harare and Bulawayo to improve water supply and sanitation as these cities are experiencing critical water supply challenges.</p>

        <p>Market maize grain availability is declining as more households increase their dependence on market purchases, particularly in deficit-producing areas. However, some surplus-producing areas remain well-supplied with grain. The USD prices of basic food commodities, including maize meal, have remained stable in November; however, the ZWL prices are increasing in line with official and parallel market exchange rate increases. Households continue to expand their engagement in income-earning activities such as casual labor, various forms of self-employment, livestock sales, and petty trade, including the sale of forest products to earn income, along with barter and reliance on remittances.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, Zimbabwe's food security outlook for the period of June 2023 to January 2024 is mixed. While some areas are expected to have Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes, others are likely to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes due to limited household stocks and access to income for market purchases. The report highlights the need for close monitoring of rainfall totals and distribution throughout the rainy season to assess the impact of the El NiÃ±o on crop production. The government's efforts to improve water supply and sanitation in critical areas are commendable, but more needs to be done to address the underlying causes of the cholera outbreak and ensure that all Zimbabweans have access to clean water and good sanitation.</p>
