        <h3>BSc (Hons) Mining Engineering</h3>
        <h4>University of Zimbabwe</h4>
      <!-- About me content here -->
        
         <p>I am a dedicated mining engineer with a BSc (Hons) in Mining Engineering from the University of Zimbabwe, with experience in Geospatial Techniques and Advanced Machine Learning. I am excited about two main areas: first, examining how human activities impact microbial communities; second, integrating remote sensing with microbial data. Recent studies indicate a disconnect between the types of microbes present and their functional capabilities. Changes in environmental conditions can affect taxonomic diversity; however, functional redundancy often helps maintain ecosystem stability. This relationship is particularly relevant concerning per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), persistent environmental contaminants known to significantly alter microbial community structures and functions.</p>

        <p>I aim to explore advanced sequencing technologies that investigate microbial interactions and resilience mechanisms across diverse ecosystems—especially regarding PFAS exposure. Understanding how these pollutants impact microbial communities is crucial for developing strategies that mitigate their effects on ecosystem health. Furthermore, I plan to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to merge high-resolution remote sensing data with microbial metagenomic datasets. Current research emphasizes the need for improved methodologies when integrating complex omics data. By developing standardized workflows for omics data analysis and enhancing model interpretability, I hope to create robust predictive models for ecosystem health that can inform policy decisions and management strategies. Additionally, I'm interested in automating species detection in remote sensing imagery using deep learning algorithms—this could complement microbial evaluations by providing insights into diversity patterns across various environments.</p>
