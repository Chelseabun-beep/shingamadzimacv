        <figcaption><em>Figure 1. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showing fungal interaction with carbonate substrates, formation of biominerals through metal complexation with Ca and Mg of substrates and the alteration of substrates through bioweathering. a. Formation of Glushinskite biominerals by Mg complexation and adhering to hyphae as single large crystals (40 μm). Much finer Ca-oxalates are observable in the background. b. Fungal hyphae entirely encrusted with biominerals (mainly Ca-oxalates) while the substrate background shows a newly formed biomineralized substrate. c. A dolomite crystal showing fungally produced intragranular porosity being refilled with biominerals. The fill is composed of micron-size crystals “laid” in the “nest.” The size of the biomineral crystals outside the nest is larger, suggesting a different process or controls of formation. d. Differential dissolution induced by fungi along lines of substrate weakness. The cleavage planes on calcite crystals show straight and deep dissolution compared to the rest of the thin section. The pitting dissolution marks the entire thin section and produced columnar structures. It indicates removal of finer material. The fungal hyphae network crisscrossing the surface should be noticed. e. Differential dissolution induced by fungi along lines of substrate weakness and neoformation of biominerals which shows that the cleavage was filled with Ca-oxalates. f. Formation of alveolar-honeycomb structures by fungal interaction with dolomitic substrates. The chambers are deep and empty while the separating walls are topped by biominerals (white crystals). Here, the biomineral deposition on the grain boundaries is sharper and a clear layer of Ca-oxalate substrate has formed. The chambers form moldic porosity after the dissolved dolomite grains (Kolo and Claeys, 2005; Kolo et al., 2007).</em></figcaption>
