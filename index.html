        <h3>BSc (Hons) Mining Engineering</h3>
        <h4>University of Zimbabwe</h4>
      <!-- About me content here -->
        
         <p>I am a dedicated mining engineer with a BSc (Hons) in Mining Engineering from the University of Zimbabwe, with experience in Geospatial Techniques and Advanced Machine Learning. I am excited about two main areas: first, examining how human activities impact microbial communities; second, integrating remote sensing with microbial data. Recent studies indicate a disconnect between the types of microbes present and their functional capabilities. Changes in environmental conditions can affect taxonomic diversity; however, functional redundancy often helps maintain ecosystem stability. This relationship is particularly relevant concerning per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), persistent environmental contaminants known to significantly alter microbial community structures and functions.</p>

        <p>I aim to explore advanced sequencing technologies that investigate microbial interactions and resilience mechanisms across diverse ecosystemsâ€”especially regarding PFAS exposure. Understanding how these pollutants impact microbial communities is crucial for developing strategies that mitigate their effects on ecosystem health. Furthermore, I plan to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to merge high-resolution remote sensing data with microbial metagenomic datasets. Current research emphasizes the need for improved methodologies when integrating complex omics data. By developing standardized workflows for omics data analysis and enhancing model interpretability, I hope to create robust predictive models for ecosystem health that can inform policy decisions and management strategies. Additionally, I'm interested in automating species detection in remote sensing imagery using deep learning algorithmsâ€”this could complement microbial evaluations by providing insights into diversity patterns across various environments.</p>

           <h3>Veld Fires Zimbabwe 2023</h3>
           <p class="post-date">Posted on September 11, 2023</p>
      <img src="VF.png" alt="Veld Fires in Zimbabwe" class="responsive">
           <p>According to the article, Zimbabwe is expected to experience medium to high-risk veld fires this year. The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has warned that the country is in the following categories: Low risk (18.14%), Medium risk (41.25%), High risk (39.56%), and Extreme risk (1.05%) of the total land area of Zimbabwe.</p>

           <p>The veld fire susceptibility increased owing to the 2022/23 rainfall season that has been normal to above normal thus supporting the growth of biomass, which when dry will act as fuel load resulting in intense veld fires. Through Notice no 76 of 4 August 2023, the Environment Minister gazetted the 2023 Fire Restriction Period as running from 31 July to 30 November 2023.</p>

           <p>Already during the first week of the 2023 Fire Restriction period, a total of 412 fire incidences that burnt 34,194.31 ha of veld were reported. However, most of these fires were observed to be largely management fires coming from fire guard construction, early burning and block burning, ongoing disregarding the onset of the Fire Restriction period.</p>

           <p>The provinces highly exposed to veld fires in the year 2023 are Mashonaland West, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, and Matabeleland North while districts that fall at extreme risk are Nyanga, Mutasa, Mutare, and Chimanimani.</p>

         <h3>Risk Management in Engineering Projects: A Key to Thriving in the Metaverse</h3>
         <p class="post-date">Posted on August 27, 2023</p>
         <p>Risk management, a cornerstone of project management in engineering, involves identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings. But how does this principle translate to the metaverse, a virtual reality space where users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users?</p>

          <p>The metaverse, with its limitless potential, is akin to a mega engineering project. It's a complex, dynamic system that requires careful planning, execution, and most importantly, risk management. In the metaverse, risks can manifest in various forms - technical glitches, security breaches, privacy concerns, and even user behavior. For instance, a technical glitch could disrupt the user experience, while a security breach could compromise user data. Just as in engineering projects, these risks need to be identified, assessed, and mitigated. For example, regular system audits can help identify technical vulnerabilities, while robust encryption protocols can safeguard against security breaches.</p>

        <p>Moreover, risk management in the metaverse also involves anticipating and preparing for future scenarios. This could range from technological advancements that could render certain features obsolete, to regulatory changes that could impact the metaverse's operations. In conclusion, risk management, a vital principle in engineering project management, holds the key to navigating the metaverse successfully. By identifying, assessing, and controlling risks, we can ensure a safe, secure, and seamless experience for all users in the metaverse.</p>

           <h3>Challenges faced by local government in Tailings Management</h3>
           <p class="post-date">Posted on July 29, 2023</p>
           <p>Mining companies across Zimbabwe face increasing pressure from regulating authorities to find safer and more sustainable solutions for their tailings storage facilities. Due to the continuing risk of failure of tailings dams â€“ and the potential high environmental impact â€“ mining companies are compelled to take significant responsibility in finding safe rehabilitation solutions for their deposits.</p>

           <p>A multitude of solutions cost-effective tailings management and extensive knowledge on the efficient use of water put companies at the forefront of helping mines by offering re-handling and reprocessing solutions. The high economic potential for â€˜reminingâ€™ valuable minerals from legacy mining waste in tailings dams, a range of integrated solutions for tailings dewatering and mineral separation processing must be developed.</p>
         
         <p>Sustainable slurry transport is an effective and low-cost alternative to truck and shovel transport for the rehandling of stored mine tailings. This is especially the case where road transportation is not viable or large elevations in terrain have to be overcome. There is developed a semi-mobile tailings slurrification unit (TSU) for slurry generation and transport to a destination site. This is a sustainable alternative to conventional hauling equipment as it can be fed by an amphibious excavator and operate in areas with low bearing capacity (for example, due to high water content). Using a TSU significantly reduces the carbon footprint and personnel required in a tailings storage facility (TSF). In addition, it is a feasible and mobile alternative to diesel trucks in difficult-to-access and/or restricted areas.</p>

           <p>Effective water management is vital for sustainable mining operations, especially as many sites now face challenging limits on their freshwater intake, as well as discharge qualities. This is one of the key reasons why tailings thickeners are used: they settle out suspended solids and return the water back to the process plant to reduce the need for external fresh water. To enable the plant operator to continuously measure the rheology of the mine tailings an Autonomous Rheo Meter (ARM). The ARM measures rheology parameters of non-Newtonian slurries. As this process no longer needs to be done manually, this results in more improved measurement data, limited maintenance requirements and real-time data, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
         
         <p>As experts on slurry technology, our in-house innovations ensure optimal and safe water extraction and reuse in dewatering processes. Our extensive knowledge about soft sediments, slurry transport and rheology has allowed us to develop several unique technologies for water management and the beneficial reuse of tailings to create circular solutions.</p>

           <p>By combining all our different fields of expertise and having offices and representation in all major mining regions, we are able to offer a variety of bespoke tailings solutions.</p>

           <h3>How Can AI improve science in Zimbabwe?</h3>
           <p class="post-date">Posted on July 12, 2023</p>
        <p>According to a recent article in ScienceDaily, the metaverse can lead to better science in four main ways :</p>

        <p>1. Removing barriers and making science more accessible Virtual environments can be used to make science more accessible to people who might not have access to traditional laboratory settings. For example, scientists at the University College London School of Pharmacy have created a digital replica of their lab that can be visited in virtual reality. This allows scientists from around the world to collaborate and make decisions together about how to move a research project forward.</p>

        <p>2. Improving teaching and learning : Virtual environments can be used to provide experiential learning opportunities that are difficult to replicate in the real world. For example, a virtual laboratory training developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention teaches young scientists in many different locations to identify the parts of a lab and even conduct emergency procedures.</p>

        <p>3. Enhancing scientific communication: Virtual environments can be used to facilitate communication between scientists from different parts of the world. For example, virtual conferences can be held in the metaverse, allowing scientists to share their research and collaborate on new projects.</p>

        <p>4. Enabling new forms of research : Virtual environments can be used to conduct research that would be difficult or impossible to do in the real world. For example, virtual reality simulations can be used to study complex systems that are difficult to observe directly.</p>

        <p>In Zimbabwe, the metaverse could be used to address some of the challenges facing the scientific community. For example, the country has a shortage of laboratory facilities and equipment, which can make it difficult for scientists to conduct research. By using virtual environments, scientists in Zimbabwe could collaborate with researchers from around the world and access cutting-edge equipment and facilities that might not be available locally. Additionally, the metaverse could be used to improve science education in Zimbabwe. Virtual laboratory training programs could be developed to provide students with hands-on experience in a safe and controlled environment. This could help to address the shortage of skilled scientists in the country and improve the quality of scientific research. In conclusion, the metaverse has the potential to revolutionize the way science is conducted and communicated. By removing barriers and making science more accessible, improving teaching and learning, enhancing scientific communication, and enabling new forms of research, the metaverse can help to address some of the challenges facing the scientific community in Zimbabwe and around the world.</p>

         <h3>Food Security Outlook June 2023 to January 2024</h3>
         <p class="post-date">Posted on June 21, 2023</p>
         <img src="FOOD.png" alt="Food Insecurity in Zimbabwe" class="responsive">
         <p>Access to water is declining across most typical semi-arid areas where rainfall has been well below average in November. In these areas, livestock and some people travel longer than normal distances to access water, reducing the time available for households to engage in other domestic and livelihood activities. Pasture conditions are also deteriorating in these areas, mainly negatively impacting cattle body conditions. A lack of access to clean water and good sanitation is also continuing to drive the national cholera outbreak, with more than 9,000 suspected cases and nearly 160 suspected cholera deaths recorded since February. Cases have been reported in 46 districts in all 10 provinces. In November, the government declared a state of emergency over Harare as cholera cases spiked and activated the Civil Protection Act. The government also set up Water Technical Committees in Harare and Bulawayo to improve water supply and sanitation as these cities are experiencing critical water supply challenges.</p>

        <p>Market maize grain availability is declining as more households increase their dependence on market purchases, particularly in deficit-producing areas. However, some surplus-producing areas remain well-supplied with grain. The USD prices of basic food commodities, including maize meal, have remained stable in November; however, the ZWL prices are increasing in line with official and parallel market exchange rate increases. Households continue to expand their engagement in income-earning activities such as casual labor, various forms of self-employment, livestock sales, and petty trade, including the sale of forest products to earn income, along with barter and reliance on remittances.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, Zimbabwe's food security outlook for the period of June 2023 to January 2024 is mixed. While some areas are expected to have Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes, others are likely to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes due to limited household stocks and access to income for market purchases. The report highlights the need for close monitoring of rainfall totals and distribution throughout the rainy season to assess the impact of the El NiÃ±o on crop production. The government's efforts to improve water supply and sanitation in critical areas are commendable, but more needs to be done to address the underlying causes of the cholera outbreak and ensure that all Zimbabweans have access to clean water and good sanitation.</p>

           <p>Here are the top 5 trends:</p>
           <p>1. Subsidized Metaverse Hardware Will Be Critical for Mass Adoption: Roy Barak, CEO of Amdocsâ€™ Vindicia, believes that subsidizing hardware works as a lower-cost entry, which can be critical for mass adoption. In 2023, hardware manufacturers should start looking towards the mobile industry, offering installment plans for metaverse hardware throughout an internet or wireless contract to lower the cost of entry for consumers.</p>

           <p>2. Make Strides in Delivering Tangible Metaverse Use Cases: Ric Garner, managing director of workforce readiness consulting at NTT DATA, predicts that in 2023, companies will make strides in delivering more specific, tangible use cases that will better connect with people to generate more opportunities.</p>

           <p>3. Metaverse Will Be the Playground of Merged Reality: Bart Schouw, chief evangelist at Software AG, believes that the metaverse will be the playground of merged reality. While there is still the risk that the metaverse will follow the same ill fate as Second Life, it doesnâ€™t have to be so.</p>

           <p>4. VR and AR Games, Virtual Galleries, Art Exhibitions, Real Estate, Social Networking Spaces, etc.: According to Metaverse Insider, VR and AR games, virtual galleries, art exhibitions, real estate, social networking spaces, etc., are the present trends for the metaverse. Enhanced avatar technology, art galleries, web 3.0, mixed realities, and more are expected to become trends of the metaverse in 2023.</p>
